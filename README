Testafy's Java API wrapper is copyright 2012 Grant Street Group, and is released under the GPLv3.
It consists of a single package, com.testafy, containing:
    - the primary class Test 
    and two additional helper classes, 
        - APIException
        - TestafyResponseHandler

Testafy.jar is an archive of the .class files for the project.
To use it, include Testafy.jar in your classpath, along with its 5 dependencies:
    httpcore-4.2.jar
    httpclient-4.2.jar
    commons-codec-1.6.jar
    commons-logging-1.1.1.jar
    gson-2.2.1.jar

Once you have these 6 files in your classpath, you can
    import com.testafy.Test;
and start running tests.


The source code of Testafy's Java API wrapper is contained in an Eclipse project, created using Eclipse 3.7 (AKA Indigo).
If you are using a different version of eclipse, we recommend creating a new project rather than importing the existing one, as there may be significant version differences.
